# Phone Call Data Analysis Application

This project is a C++ Builder application designed to analyze one month of phone call data. It reads data from a CSV file, calculates the duration and cost of each call, sorts the data, and generates reports based on various criteria.

## Features

- Dynamically create UI elements
- Load and display phone call data from a CSV file
- Calculate the duration of each phone call
- Sort call data by service provider or starting time
- Filter and generate reports based on specific phone extensions
  
## Prerequisites

- C++ Builder IDE

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phone-call-data-analysis.git
   cd phone-call-data-analysis
   ```

2. **Open the Project**
- Open the project in C++ Builder(Embarcadero RAD Studio)
- Ensure the OneMonthData.csv file is located in the AppData folder at the same level as your source code.

## Conclusion

The Phone Call Data Analysis Application provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing phone call data over a month. By leveraging C++ Builder, the application offers a user-friendly interface to dynamically load, display, and process call data from a CSV file. The implementation of features such as calculating call durations, sorting data, and generating reports based on specific criteria demonstrates the applicationâ€™s robust functionality. This project not only fulfills the requirements of the practical test for Technical Programming 2 but also showcases the practical application of C++ in handling and analyzing real-world data.

The structured and modular approach in the code ensures ease of maintenance and scalability, allowing future enhancements and adaptations. The clear setup instructions and well-documented code further facilitate understanding and utilization of the application by other developers or users.

This project underscores the importance of data analysis in telecommunication and offers a valuable tool for extracting meaningful insights from call data, ultimately aiding in better decision-making and operational efficiency.
